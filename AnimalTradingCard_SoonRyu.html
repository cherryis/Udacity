    <p class="p2">Chows are powerful, compactly built dogs standing as high as 20 inches at the shoulder.
      Their distinctive traits include a lion’s-mane ruff around the head and shoulders;
      a blue-black tongue; deep-set almond eyes that add to a scowling, snobbish expression;
      and a stiff-legged gait. Chows can have rough or smooth coats of red, black, blue, cinnamon, or cream.</p>
